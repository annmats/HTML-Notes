Hello everyone. Good afternoon. I am one of the representative 
of Content Team. Our team is lead by Maam Phoebe Apale-Mula. 
Then, the members are Maam Charlene Tessa Descallar,
Sir Michael Banjo Poblete, Maam Catherine Mae Bilar, 
Sir Grant Yeban, and yours truly Mary Ann Matuguina.

So, what we do?
We migrate content. Our tasks involves the following:
•Content Migration
•Data Entry / Enrichment
• Website Testing / QA

Content Migration by definition 
is the process of moving content from one content management
system (CMS) to another. For this task we use 
Content Management System or CMS platform to 
easily manage content.

Next, Data Entry by definition is the job of entering
text or other data into a computer. This task is usually
about migrating data from datasheets.

Then, Website Testing / QA, for this task we review product's
findability then sometimes we QA the migrated pages prior 
publishing.

(This is the old content of PEI, then after migration this 
is the new content for their new website.)

To achieve this, this is the CMS platform we use to migrate
content.

We use different software for different client.
For our current projects these are the CMS platforms we use.
•Xperience by Kentico for IBS, PEI-Genesis, and Symmetry Elex
•Craft CMS for AIONX, MarketPush, CatalystUnitySolutions,
ARKCO Sales and Bowmar
•Then, Wordpress for KITZ

Example for Symmetry electronics, this task is about
removing broken internal and external links, and changing 
duplicates of H1 tags to H2. So to do this, using Kentico
software we will unlink those broken links or edit tags.

For upcoming project we have Melchioni, we recently completed 
the data enhancement of 9000 datas. And we are waiting for the 
upcoming additions.

That would be all. Thank you and Welcome to ISI.
